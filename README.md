# InsightGenAI

**InsightGenAI** is a flexible, AI-driven assessment framework designed to help organizations generate strategic insights across multiple domains, from innovation and customer focus to operational efficiency and risk management. Using generative AI, this project enables quick and precise evaluations that empower both short- and long-term strategic planning.

## Key Features
- **Generic Assessment Framework**: Adaptable to various strategic questions by defining specific assessment goals and creating custom question sets.
- **Powered by Generative AI**: Utilizes OpenAI Large Language Models for insight generation, transforming raw responses into valuable recommendations.
- **Refinement Through AI Chains**: A multi-step refinement process ensures that assessments are accurate, consistent, and highly relevant for decision-making.
- **Scalable and Reusable**: Designed to be easily repurposed across different strategic assessments, allowing organizations to continuously track and improve their performance in various areas.

## How It Works
1. **Define the Strategic Question**: Identify the key area for assessment, such as innovation maturity or operational efficiency.
2. **Select or Develop a Business Model**: Choose an existing model (e.g., Innovation Maturity Model) or create a custom framework for the assessment.
3. **Generate Questions**: Develop targeted questions based on the chosen model to gather relevant data.
4. **Raw Data Analysis**: The AI processes responses to create an initial outline of insights.
5. **Refinement with AI Chains**: The raw data undergoes several refinement steps to ensure clarity, consistency, and actionability.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and workflow management.
- **LangChain**: Manages the flow of raw data through various AI processing stages to create refined assessments.
- **OpenAI**: Provides the generative AI models that perform data analysis and insight generation.
