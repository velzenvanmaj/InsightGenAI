# InsightGenAI

**InsightGenAI** is a flexible, AI-driven assessment methodology designed to help organizations generate strategic insights across multiple domains, from innovation and customer focus to operational efficiency and risk management. Using generative AI, this project enables quick and precise evaluations that empower both short- and long-term strategic planning.

In this example, the methodology is applied to the strategic question: **"How Innovative are we really?"** The example includes an analysis and recommendations based on synthetically generated responses for a hypothetical organization.

## Key Features
- **Generic Assessment Methodology**: Adaptable to various strategic questions by defining specific assessment goals and creating custom question sets.
- **Powered by Generative AI**: Utilizes OpenAI Large Language Models for insight generation, transforming raw responses into valuable recommendations.
- **Refinement Through AI Chains**: A multi-step refinement process with user and system prompts ensures that assessments are accurate, consistent, and highly relevant for decision-making.
- **Scalable and Reusable**: Designed to be easily repurposed across different strategic assessments, allowing organizations to continuously track and improve their performance in various areas.

## How It Works
1. **Define the Strategic Question**: Identify the key area for assessment, such as innovation maturity or operational efficiency.
2. **Select or Develop a Business Model**: Choose an existing model (e.g., Innovation Maturity Model) or create a custom framework for the assessment.
3. **Generate Questions**: Develop targeted questions based on the chosen model to gather relevant data.
4. **Raw Data Analysis**: The AI processes responses to create an initial outline of insights.
5. **Refinement with AI Chains**: The raw data undergoes several refinement steps through chains of user and system prompts to ensure clarity, consistency, and actionability.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and workflow management.
- **LangChain**: Manages the flow of raw data through various AI processing stages to create refined assessments.
- **OpenAI**: Provides the generative AI models that perform data analysis and insight generation.

## Setup Instructions
To use InsightGenAI, you must set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. This can be done by defining `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment.
