## Evaluation of Innovation Maturity

### Innovation Maturity Model (IMM)

The Innovation Maturity Model (IMM) assesses your company's readiness and capability to innovate across key areas: vision, leadership support, culture, processes, technology, and collaboration. It categorizes maturity into stages from Initial (sporadic, unstructured innovation) to Optimizing (continuous, integral innovation).

### Key Observations

#### Innovation Vision

- **Clarity and Communication:** Scores ranged from 1 to 5. Some departments understand the vision well (4-5), while others find it unclear (1-2), indicating inconsistent communication.

#### Leadership Support

- **Encouragement and Engagement:** Scores varied from 1 to 5. Some respondents felt strong support (4-5), while others perceived minimal support (1-2), suggesting uneven engagement.

#### Innovation Culture

- **Promotion of New Ideas:** Feedback was mixed; some highlighted a supportive environment, while others noted barriers, indicating an uneven culture of innovation.

#### Structured Processes

- **Presence and Sufficiency:** Significant disparity in perceptions. Some acknowledged structured processes (4-5), while others noted a lack (1-2), highlighting the need for better processes.

#### Technology Utilization

- **Technological Integration:** Mixed results. Some rated technology use highly (4-5), while others found it inadequate (1-2), pointing to gaps in integration and accessibility.

#### Collaboration
